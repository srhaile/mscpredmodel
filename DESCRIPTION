Description: Set of functions to facilitate the comparison and external 
    validation of prediction models and prognostic scores using a network meta-
    analytic approach called multiple score comparison from individual
    patient data. The package has functions to estimate performance estimates
    (and corresponding variances) for both calibration and discrimination endpoints,
    perform appropriate network meta-analysis, and compute all direct and
    indirect pairwise comparisons.
