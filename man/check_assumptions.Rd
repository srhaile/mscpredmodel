\title{Check assumptions of transitivity, consistency and homogeneity}
\usage{
check_transitivity(object, graph = TRUE)

check_homogeneity(object, dig = 3)

check_consistency(object, graph = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object from \code{msc}. For \code{check_consistency}, it must have been run with options \code{direct = TRUE, indirect = TRUE}}

\item{graph}{Should the results be displayed graphically? (default TRUE) If not, the coefficient table is returned.}

\item{dig}{Number of digits to be printed, see \code{\link{format.pval}}.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing results of linear regression models of the effect size (outcome) against the cohort-specific average moderator value.

A list containing datasets with tau-square, the Q likelihood ratio statistic, its degrees of freedom and its p-value.

A graph of the direct and indirect estimates for the various differences in score performance.
