# mscpredmodel

The goal of mscpredmodel is to make external validation and comparison of prediction models via the network meta-analytic approach multiple score comparison (MSC) straightforward for researchers involved in systematic reviews and (network) meta-analysis of prediction models.

## Installation

You can install the released version of mscpredmodel from [github](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("srhaile/mscpredmodel")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mscpredmodel)
dat <- msc_sample_data()
dat
M <- 1000
bs.example <- get_bs_samples(data = dat, id = id, cohorts = cohort, 
                             outcome = outcome, n.samples = M, 
                             a, b, c, e, g)
ps <- compute_performance(bs.example, fn = calibration_large, lbl = "calibration-in-the-large") 
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
